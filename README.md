# OIBSIP_2
The aim is to create a Java Programm in which a user is given K chances to estimate a randomly generated number. The game's rules are as follows:

* If the guessed number is more than the real number, the program will display the message "guessed number greater than the actual number."

* If the guessed number is less than the real number, the program will display a message indicating that the guessed number is less than the actual number.

*  If the guessed number is the same as the real number, or if all K trials have been completed, the program will terminate with an appropriate message.
